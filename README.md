# shapemachine
i have created a shape machine  where we can generate random shapes (with valid dimensions, i.e. no negative or zero sides or radius,  all integers).Shape is abstract class, and every shape has a unique id.Then a main method (with driver class) to instantiate a Canvas containing 10 random non-duplicate shapes and printing them .
